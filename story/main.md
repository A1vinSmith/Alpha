## Rule
0. There two oppisite, follow the rebllion to fight your enemy.
1. your phone is POWER, it can hack every system without any traces by wired and wireless.
2. the phone is key & your weakness, it'll leak your positon if you show too much. enemies would caught you.
3. Do things large would exposure !!!
4. To win is survive until find the rebllion in the world, which is SLIENT spacecraft.
5. the spy already knew the power exsist, but they do not know where excatly. So hunrands are sent spys.
6. The rebellion army would come to you without any connection. In 90? days later.
7. So you have to make sure find&kill them all in the last day. Which not explosure anything.

## World View
0. plant - spacecraft - Near space station
1. Interstellar colonization/immigrants
2. AI imitate 100%
3. So the spy exsist chips
4. Find them all & kill
5. Then find the rebellion army...

## PS
1. the spy not Nanometer, it's chip embraced a hunam body

### Ablity Chapter1
1. Control all wift&network, but why you just kill all AI? time and space limited.
2. So you can not explosure yourself until find rebellion army.
3. The spy in your plant, normally not use wifi, so you couldn't find them all or anyone.
4. Spy not know the power excatly yet, so you can not explosure. You must survey and Cited snake out of the hole. Kill them all, but not explosure your plant have the power.
5. So how to survey? x-ray? it's already controlled by AI, so it's planB always... Beacause you can not hack hospital then tell everyone there is spy, it'll be explosure all.
6. Then there is another way, althrough, ai settled tracking device to all spacecraft to watch near space station. To use the spacecrafts with hundrands people, and tell everyone spy exsist by accident. Then you'll find something.
