## Rule
0. There two opposite, follow the rebellion to fight your enemy.
1. your phone is POWER, it can hack every system without any traces
    by wired and wireless.
2. the phone is key & your weakness, it'll leak your position if you show too much. 
    enemies would caught you.
3. Do things large would exposure !!!
4. To win is survive until find the rebellion in the world, which is SILENT spacecraft.
5. the spy already knew the power exist, but they do not know where exactly. 
    So hundreds are sent spies.
6. The rebellion army would come to you without any connection. In 90? days later.
7. So you have to make sure find&kill them all in the last day. 
    Which not exposure anything.

## World View
0. plant - spacecraft - Near space station
1. Interstellar colonization/immigrants
2. AI imitate 100%
3. So the spy exist chips
4. Find them all & kill
5. Then find the rebellion army...

## PS
1. the spy not Nanometer, it's chip embraced a human body

### Ability Chapter1
1. Control all wifi&network, but why you just kill all AI? time and space limited.
2. So you can not exposure yourself until find rebellion army.
3. The spy in your plant, normally not use wifi, so you can not find them all or anyone.
4. Spy not know the power exactly yet, so you can not exposure yourself. 
    You must survey and Cited snake out of the hole. Kill them all, 
    but not exposure your plant have the power.
5. So how to survey? x-ray? it's already controlled by AI, so it's planB always...
    Because you can not hack hospital then tell everyone there is spy, 
    it'll be exposure all.
6. Then there is another way, although, ai settled tracking device to all spacecraft 
    to watch near space station. To use the spacecrafts with hundreds people, 
    and tell everyone spy exist by accident. Then you'll find something.
