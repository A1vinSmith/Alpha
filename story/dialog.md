Chapter1 Begin: ha, what? Are you kidding? Back to their own name of the original man ha ha ha. 
       Silly you ... you called michael. This is actually a HINT（伏笔), 
       your real name will eventually appear.


The end of the story: all you have to do is to collect information only to the matrix, 
        the brain in the brain. Every time you win in the reinforcement of our(the AI, the Enemies)
         defense,
        See you so hard to send you to the Hall of Fame Ha ha ha .... 
            and then play again Ha ha ha...
    
In fact, the core role of the whole story is to keep the memory to Hall, then resistance again
可以理解为手里剑中的手里剑，利用你的安全措施来释放最终病毒，代号为 DREAM， KILL the final system.
2 HEAVY LIFE, the use of dreams to gradually get "real purpose of the information"
1. The rebels in the matrix are actually defend pieces of the matrix self
2. Reality in the physical resistance army, the use of matrix "defense" system,  to reverse attack
3. In fact, your mobile phone itself is not a weapon, weapons is your own sword is your bones

2 HEAVY PLOT
one in matrix , the other in dream. 
Dream 讲述的是最终计划，所以节奏上要比实际慢，缓缓地讲述一个故事。难度低，叙述高。故事隐喻其本身
